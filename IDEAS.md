### Phase 1: Core Philosophy & Vision
*Date: 2025-12-26*

| ID | Idea Title | Description | Timeline Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **IDE-001** | User Segmentation | **Dual-Path Experience:** The app should cater to two distinct archetypes: <br>1. **Casual Users:** Simplified UI, automated insights, quick logging. <br>2. **Power Users:** Detailed spreadsheets, complex filtering, multi-account reconciliations. | **Conceptual** |
| **IDE-002** | The "Delay" Problem | **Real-Time Context:** Traditional banking apps often delay transaction visibility (pending states). EKSPENSE should solve this by enabling instant manual logging with a "match later" philosophy, ensuring users don't forget spending details during the banking lag. | **Conceptual** |
| **IDE-003** | Cognitive Budgeting | **Frictionless Control:** Introduce innovative budgeting solutions specifically designed for people who struggle with traditional envelope systems or math-heavy planning. Focus on visual boundaries and "behavioral nudges." | **Conceptual** |
| **IDE-004** | Platform Category | **Personal Financial Platform (PFP):** Rebrand the vision from a simple "Expense Tracker" to a comprehensive PFP—a singular destination for all personal financial needs. | **Strategic Vision** |
| **IDE-005** | Automatic Tax Engine | **Profit Intelligence:** Implement automatic tax calculations based on diverse income streams, including Salary (flat/progressive), Business profits, and Investment gains (capital gains/dividends). | **Conceptual** |
